# CommonGround

**Hack4Change 2026 — Hackathon submission**

CommonGround is a real-time donation coordination platform built for the Greater Moncton Homelessness Steering Committee (GMHSC) network of 28 homeless-serving organizations. It replaces informal texts and emails with a shared system where donors can see exactly what is needed, organizations can manage their inventory and post shortages, and coordinators get a live network-wide picture.

---

## The Problem

28 shelters and support organizations in Moncton coordinate donated goods informally — through text messages, phone calls, and emails. Some organizations are overstocked with items other organizations critically need. There is no shared system, and donations often go to the wrong place or expire unmatched.

## The Solution

CommonGround connects three groups in one web application:

- **Donors** — Browse the live needs board and submit donations through a simple form. A smart matching engine compares your items against all active needs across the network and recommends the top 3 organizations, with plain-language reasoning.
- **Shelter staff** — Log in to manage their organization's inventory, flag shortages, post needs with urgency levels, and confirm incoming donations.
- **Network coordinators** — See a live dashboard of all 28 organizations: critical shortage heatmap, full donations pipeline, rule-based insights on redistribution opportunities, and CSV exports.

## AI Disclosure

*Required per Hack4Change submission rules.*

**AI tools used in development:** We used Cursor IDE with Claude (Anthropic) as a coding assistant to accelerate development — for generating boilerplate, debugging, and documentation. All AI-generated code was reviewed and modified by the team before use.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript |
| Backend | Node.js, Express.js |
| Database | MySQL (via MySQL Workbench) |
| Matching | Rule-based weighted scoring (no external API) |
| Auth | JWT (access + refresh tokens, httpOnly cookies) |

No build tools, no framework dependencies. Runs with `npm run dev`.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MySQL server running locally (or remote)
- A MySQL user with access to create databases (see `create db.txt`)

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The only values you must change to run locally are the database credentials (which default to the hackathon dev values).

### 3. Create the database and seed data

```bash
npm run migrate
```

This drops and recreates all tables, inserts all 28 GMHSC organizations, sample inventory, needs, and donations.

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Roles

- **Coordinator** = Network admin. Logs in with coordinator credentials and has full visibility across all 28 organizations. The coordinator dashboard at `/coordinator` is the main admin interface for donation coordination.
- **Staff** = Organization-scoped. Manages one organization's inventory, needs, and donations. Can request surplus from other orgs and confirm incoming transfers.

## Pages

| URL | Access | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Public | Live needs board — all 28 orgs with top needs, filterable |
| `/give` | Public | Donation landing — choose to give items or financial donation |
| `/donate` | Public | 4-step donation form with automatic matching |
| `/all-needs` | Public | Paginated list of all active needs across the network |
| `/staff` | Staff login required | Inventory, needs, incoming donations, incoming transfers, request surplus from other orgs |

## Matching & Insights (No AI Required)

Donation matching and network insights use **automatic rule-based logic** — no AI or API keys needed.

**Donation Matching** (`POST /api/ai/match-donation`): Matches donations to needs by category, item name similarity, urgency level, and quantity fit. Returns top 3 organizations. Runs entirely on the server with no external API calls.

**Network Insights** (`POST /api/ai/network-insights`): Generates a summary from current data: critical needs count, surplus items, redistribution opportunities (surplus at one org matching a need at another), and organizations needing follow-up (stale inventory). Rule-based only.

## Deployment

### Deploying to a VPS or server

1. Set `NODE_ENV=production` in your environment
2. Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` if serving over HTTPS
3. Point `CORS_ORIGINS` to your production domain
4. Use a process manager like PM2: `pm2 start backend/server.js --name commonground`
5. Put Nginx or Caddy in front for SSL termination

### Database on production

Use any managed MySQL service (PlanetScale, Railway, AWS RDS) and update the `DB_*` environment variables.
